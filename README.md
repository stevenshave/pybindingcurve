# Usage

# Installation


# Requirements
PyBindingCurve was developed using python 3.7.1, but should work on any Python 3.6 or greater distribution.  It does however rely upon the lm_fit library to fit (and critically), return a 95% error band for the fit parameter, achieved by lmfit expanding upon the standard numpy fitting routines.
* Python (>=3.6)
* Matplotlib (2.x)
* Numpy (1.15.x)
* lm_fit (1.0.0)
* mpmath (1.1.0)
